        <p>The most salient and noteworthy feature of the
            behavior of animate entities is that it is organized.
            The actions of living things reflect a directed coordination of functions and processes toward specific
            ends people’s motivation is explicit and conscious; at other
            times behavior is clearly energized and directed by
            nonconscious, implicit aims and attitudes. Finally,
            whether motives are implicit or explicit, the behavior organized by them will be variously successful.
            Effective motivation requires not only arousal or
            energy but also guidance by an affective and cognitive system that, at least for most of us, is susceptible
            to distraction or depletion.<br> That behavior sequences are typically coherent and internally regulated, and thus demonstrate
            equifinality and adaptability is one of the great wonders of our science. It is also the central focus of the
            field of motivation.<p>
             </p>This Oxford Handbook of Motivation is concerned
            in particular with human motivation, with all the
            complications that topic entails. Like that of other
            organisms, human behavior betrays an internal
            organization, actively operating within its environment,
             and employing layered, interacting functions and processes.
             Humans are clearly motivated, goal-directed, creatures. 
             They seek out specific ends, ranging from concrete goals such as obtaining food and
            shelter to abstract ones such as developing a sense
            of meaning or attaining aesthetic ideals.</p>

        <p>Human well- being” (Becker, 1968, p. xiii). TMT
        argues that our personal goals and cultural activities are mainly focused on self- esteem maintenance,
        which in turn serves as a buff er from awareness of
        mortality. Defense against the anxiety associated
        with death is thus in the TMT view a principal
        driving force of symbolic and cultural activities, and
        the generation of meanings and purposes. TMT has
        harnessed experimental techniques to assess attitudes
        and motivations following mortality salience events,
        with results that suggest that people are indeed often
        acting out of nonconscious defensive attempts to
        stave off existential threat. TMT challenges the view
        of humans as conscious and rational beings, showing instead that underlying ultimate concerns can
        in some individuals automatically activate complex, 
        and sometimes defensive, behaviors and attitudes</p>
