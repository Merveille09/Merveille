    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>One of the characteristic features of behavioral
        science is its frequent use of statistical inference in
        the development of laws and principles. Although
        there are clearly limits to inductive- statistical
         explanations of events (see classic work by Hempel,
        1965), the probabilistic and multidetermined nature
        of human behavior makes such methods essential
        tools of behavioral science. Yet these statistical tools
        themselves have traditionally had limitations in
        analysis have thus lent new excitement to the fi eld.
        In particular, multilevel modeling methods (e.g.,
        Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) have allowed investigators to 
        look not only at how individuals diff er from
        one another in motives and goal, but also at how
        and why an individual waxes and wanes in various
        motives and behavioral regulations across time or
        situations. Most every classical question in the fi eld
        was originally posited as a “between persons” issue.</p>
